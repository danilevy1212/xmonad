#+TITLE: Dan's xmonad config


* Rationale

=Xmonad= is a window manager written in =haskell=, a general purpose purely
functional programming language.

* _Warning_

The current repository is under heavy changes. =Nix= is being used along with
=stack= for the installation of dependencies and some extra experimentation needs
to be done before deciding on what the proper way of installing this
repositories files and output binaries is.

* TODO
** Install instructions
** No git submodules
** DEPENDECIES -> libdbusmenu-gtk3

** I INSTALLED https://github.com/EliverLara/Nordic and I am looking at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK to install it.

Not really helping you directly in doing it the way you're asking but maybe something in my blog post serves of help, since it seems most of the software you want to configure is what I have as well: https://gvolpe.com/blog/xmonad-polybar-nixos/
