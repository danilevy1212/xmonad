#+TITLE: Dan's xmonad config


* Rationale

=Xmonad= is a window manager written in =haskell=, a general purpose purely
functional programming language.

* Installation

Preresquisites:

+ stack :: Builder of the xmonad binary.
+ nix :: Package manager for external dependencies.

Clone this repository somewhere where =xmonad= can find it's ~xmonad.hs~ file:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/danilevy1212/xmonad.git ~/.xmonad
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/danilevy1212/xmonad.git ~/.config/xmonad
#+end_src

From the project root directory, run:

#+begin_src shell
stack install --nix
#+end_src

For development, it is recommended to install [[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server][Haskell Language Server]]

* _Warning_

The current repository is under heavy changes. =Nix= is being used along with
=stack= for the installation of dependencies and some extra experimentation needs
to be done before deciding on what the proper way of installing this
repositories files and output binaries is.
